# Homework: Graphing and Exploring Climate Data

This assignment focuses on enhancing students' ability to read and interpret Python code related to graphing and data exploration. By completing this homework, students will gain hands-on experience with key techniques to analyze climate datasets and prepare data for machine learning models.

## Objective

Students will use statistical tools, visualize climate trends, and apply linear regression modeling to assess relationships between CO₂ emissions and sea level rise. This foundational exercise enables meaningful analysis of climate data.

## Materials Needed

1. **Datasets:**
    - CSV file of global CO₂ levels from 1750 to 2023
    - CSV file of sea level rise from the EPA

## Program Highlights

The Python program for this homework was selected for the following reasons:

1. **Sea Level Rise Focus:** Emphasizes the importance of exploring sea level rise, one of the critical consequences of climate change.
2. **Linear Regression Modeling:** Introduces students to this foundational machine learning method by illustrating clear correlation examples.
3. **Dataset Integration:** Demonstrates how to align and combine datasets for time series analysis, a vital skill in climate-related studies.
