# Homework: Exploring SVM and KNN with a Water Quality Dataset

This assignment focuses on enhancing students' ability to read and interpret Python code related to Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). By completing this homework, students will gain hands-on experience working with water quality datasets and comparing multiple machine learning models.

## Objective

Students will apply classification techniques to real-world water quality data, analyze model performance, and develop policy recommendations based on findings. This task encourages critical thinking about the strengths and limitations of different ML approaches.

## Materials Provided

1. **Datasets:**
    - CSV files for irrigation water and drinking water datasets
    - PDF document explaining column details and data structure
2. **Images:**
    - Examples of KNN and SVM models for visualization

## Program Highlights

The Python program for this homework was chosen for the following reasons:

1. **Policy Recommendation Development:** Students will practice crafting data-driven policy memos, a crucial skill covered in the course.
2. **Model Comparisons:** Students will evaluate five ML models (SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Linear Regression) to explore how different methods can be applied to solve problems.
3. **Real-World Dataset:** This homework utilizes public datasets, allowing students to work with realistic data scenarios. The irrigation and drinking water examples illustrate how machine learning can be applied to sustainability challenges.
4. **Sustainability in Agriculture:** The assignment ties into the broader course theme of understanding agricultureâ€™s impact on environmental sustainability.
